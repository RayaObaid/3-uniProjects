## Project 1: House Prices Prediction

**Description:** This project focuses on predicting house prices using data analysis techniques.

**Details:**

**Data Cleanup:**
Started by getting our data in tip-top shape with KNIME's help. Cleaned it up to make sure we're working with the best data.

**Four Models, One Goal: Predicting Prices:**
Tried out four models in KNIME to predict house prices. Each model brought something unique to the table, and we're excited to see the results!

**Fine-Tuning for Precision:**
Picked the best model and fine-tuned it with some feature selection and optimization, making our predictions even more accurate.

## Project 2: IoT Game

**Description:** This project involves creating an interactive game using Arduino and Python, focusing on IoT integration.

**Details:**
- Features Arduino-based hardware interaction.
- Includes Python code for game logic.
- Utilizes IoT communication.

## Project 3: Heart Failure Prediction Data Warehouse

**Description:** This project involves creating a data warehouse in Power BI to predict heart failure outcomes.

**Folder:** `heart-failure-prediction`

**Details:**

**Dataset:** 
A comprehensive medical dataset from Kaggle with 12 features including age, anemia, diabetes, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, and more, with the target variable being death event (0 or 1).
**Data Cleaning:**
Meticulously cleaned the data, removing null values, ensuring no duplicates, and adjusting data types. Derived new columns for better analysis.
**Visualization Journey:**
Used Power BI to create insightful visualizations:
1. **Pie Chart:** Gender distribution. ðŸ“Š
2. **Decomposition Tree:** Dynamic breakdown of each case. ðŸŒ³
3. **Key Influencers Chart:** Unveiling the impact of features on death events. ðŸ’¡
**Insights Revealed:**
The most impactful feature on death events is the ejection fraction, closely followed by serum creatinine.
